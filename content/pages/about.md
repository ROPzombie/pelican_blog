# About the Blog and me

**This blog is currently in the alpha phase**

This is complete personal blog that operates as some kind of journal for me. Thus I want to share solutions for security challenges like writeups. Report about interesting papers, books or articles I just read. Maybe sharing some insights on topics from university. So I would be some kind of mixed, about most topics will have references to computer security.

I rather think there are no relevant or interesting things to say about me (as I assume no one will really read this blog at all). But for completeness sake: I'm a computer science student placed in Berlin (Free University Berlin) with a focus in computer security and operating systems.

For more information I will upload a CV, just in case there are people who are interested in (Google-search bot I'm looking at you :) ).
